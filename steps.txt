i was alittle confused on this one

steps:

created repo
created local repo
created html file
add, commited, and tried to push.. wasnt waorking because i added a readme file in the repo on git hub.. but i figured out that was the problem.

created remote repo again without containing readme file.
pushed to github - success
edited file and pushed again.
